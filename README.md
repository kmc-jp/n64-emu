# n64-emu
An experimental Nintendo 64 emulator.

### NOTE

n64-emu is in a very early stage of development now.
No commercial ROM can run on it.

## Build

We do not distribute pre-build binaries. 
You need to build from source.

### Prerequisites
- Little endian machine
- a C++ compiler compatible with C++20
- CMake

We support MSVC++. Clang and GCC are not tested for now.

### Linux/Windows/macOS

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:kmc-jp/n64-emu.git
cd n64-emu
mkdir build
cd build
# configure build
cmake ..
# build
make # or cmake --build .
```


## Run

Only the z64 format (big enddian) is supported.

```
./n64[.exe] <rom_file.z64>
```

## Test

```
# In build directory
ctest -C Debug
```
