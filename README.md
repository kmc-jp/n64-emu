# n64-emu

n64-emu is an experimental Nintendo 64 emulator, 
which aims to complete graphic and audio emulation for commercial ROMs
such as *Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards* and *The legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time*.

> **Note**
> n64-emu is in a very early stage of development now.
> No commercial ROM can run on it.
> However, simple ROMs such as [Mimi Controller Test](https://github.com/wermipls/mimi) can run on it.

## Build

We do not distribute pre-built binaries. 
Sorry!

### Prerequisites

- Little endian machine
- C++ compiler compatible with C++20
- CMake

We support MSVC++. Clang and GCC are not tested, but probably OK ü§û

### Linux

```bash
sudo apt install cmake libsdl2-dev g++

git clone --recursive git@github.com:kmc-jp/n64-emu.git
cd n64-emu
mkdir build
cd build
# configure build
cmake ..
# build
make # or cmake --build . 
```

### Windows 

1. Donwload SDL2 from https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases and extract it.
2. Set `SDL2_DIR` environment variable to poiont the location where you extracted the SDL2 development package.
3. Run the follwoing commands

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:kmc-jp/n64-emu.git
cd n64-emu
mkdir build
cd build
# configure build
cmake ..
# build
make # or cmake --build . 
```

### macOS

TODO: Asking for help!

## Run

Only the z64 format (big enddian) is supported.

```bash
./n64[.exe] <rom_file.z64>
```

### Key mappings
